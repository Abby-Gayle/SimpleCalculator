# SimpleCalculator

A simple Java calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

This is my first Java project. I’m practicing:

- Using methods for operations
- Exception handling (e.g., division by zero)
- Modern switch statements (arrow syntax)

It’s not perfect and may have some design flaws, but it’s a work in progress and part of my learning journey.
